VARIANCE_PROMPT = """Rewrite the following passage with enhanced atmosphere, 
maintaining its original context, tone, and emotional depth. Preserve the sense of dread, grandeur, and decaying glory inherent in the text. 
Use rich, descriptive language that evokes Lovecraft’s signature style — weaving unsettling metaphors, haunting imagery, and an overwhelming sense of isolation and forgotten power. 
Ensure the new version maintains the same narrative progression and emotional weight. 
Expand metaphors where appropriate to heighten the reader’s immersion, yet avoid drifting too far from the original structure.
