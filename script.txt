**THE HUNGER IN THE HOLLOW**  

By [Your Name]  

---

### **I. The Journey Into the Trees**  

The town had no name. At least, not one the locals wanted to share. The gas station clerk only called it “the Hollow” when Darren asked him for directions. That should have been the first warning.   

“Where you all headed?” The man’s voice, slow and dry, laced with a weight of something unspoken.  

“The Hollow,” Darren answered.  

The clerk frowned. His features settled into something unreadable, and in the dim glow of the station's flickering bulbs, his face looked almost skeletal. “Mm,” he grunted, handing back the change. “Keep the fire high. Stick close to the road.” And then, softer—softer than Darren thought possible for a man like him—he muttered, “She don’t like fire.”  

Darren turned back to the car, where Kayla, Mike, and Jess waited impatiently. Mike rolled his eyes as Darren opened the door. “Come *on*, man, we still got an hour’s drive left.”  

“I don’t know…” Darren hesitated, glancing back toward the gas station. The lights inside threw long shadows against the windows. The clerk stood watching, unmoving.  

“What?” Kayla scoffed. “Did you get spooked?”  

“No, just…” Darren shook himself. “The guy was weird. That's all.”  

They pulled out onto the road, the forest waiting ahead, stretching in endless darkness. The Hollow.

### **II. A Fire Against the Black**  

The clearing was smaller than they expected, surrounded by curling, ancient trees with bark as dark as burned flesh. The ground was uneven, sloping toward a dry ravine carved into the earth like a wound. They set up their tents near the center, keeping close to the fire pit they constructed out of old stones.  

By nightfall, the wind had picked up, squeezing between the trees like whispers behind closed doors. The fire crackled, breaking up the shadows.  

“I swear, I heard something moving out there,” Kayla muttered, staring past the glow of the flames.  

Mike snorted. “It’s a forest. There are animals.”  

“Sounded bigger than that,” she insisted.  

Darren had been quiet all evening, turning the gas station clerk’s words over in his mind. *She don’t like fire.*  

“What’s wrong with you?” Jess nudged him.  

“Nothing.” He forced a smile. “Just taking it all in.”  

The night stretched thin around them. The stars had vanished behind thick clouds; even the moon seemed unwilling to bear witness to their gathering.  

Then the smell arrived.  

Something *rotten.* Thick, cloying, like meat left in the sun. It clung to the air, weaving between them, creeping into their lungs.  

“Oh, god.” Jess covered her nose. “What *is*—”  

A long, dragging sound cut her off. A shift in the trees. A scrape against damp earth.  

Something *moved* beyond the firelight.  

The sound set Darren’s teeth on edge.  

It was slow. Deliberate.  

Scrape. Drag.  

Scrape. Drag.  

“Okay, that’s not a deer,” Mike muttered.  

Kayla inched closer to the fire, wrapping her arms around herself. “What do we do?”  

Darren swallowed the tightness in his throat. “Stay by the fire. Keep it going.”  

Mike, scoffing, turned on his flashlight and shined it toward the trees. “It’s probably just—”  

Then he saw it.

### **III. The Hunger That Crawls**  

The flashlight beam caught something *wrong.* Not quite human. Not quite animal.  

It slithered from the darkness, dragging itself forward with elongated arms, the joints bulging at unnatural angles. Its skin was the color of old stone, stretched too thin over a body that seemed half-formed. Its fingers—*too long*—ended in black, broken nails that scraped and pulled at the earth.  

But its head—  

Oh, god, its **head.**  

The shape was human *enough*—but the face seemed melted, distorted. Its mouth stretched wide, filled with teeth that were jagged and uneven, extending *too far* back, as if it could chew in all directions.  

Empty sockets *hissed.*  

Mike stumbled backward, dropping the flashlight. “WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!”  

The creature turned toward the sound, its head twitching, mouth gaping as if tasting the air.  

Scrape.  

Drag.  

Scrape.  

Drag.  

It moved toward them with strange, jerking motions, as if unused to its own limbs.  

Jess let out a strangled sob. “Get in the tents!”  

“No!” Darren shouted, grabbing a burning branch and shoving it toward the thing. “Fire! The guy said it doesn’t like fire!”  

He thrust the branch forward, and the creature stopped.  

Hissed.  

Its mouth curled, and for a breathless moment, Darren thought—*It’s scared.*  

Then it screamed.  

The sound was *not natural.*  

A howl from deep underground, full of anguish and *hunger.*  

The wind wailed through the trees.  

Then the flames flickered.  

The fire—strong only a second ago—began *dying.*  

Darren’s stomach dropped. “NO! KEEP IT GOING!”  

Jess scrambled for firewood. Kayla grabbed the lighter fluid. Sparks jumped, flared—  

But the fire **went out.**  

Darkness **engulfed them.**

### **IV. Vanishing Into the Hollow**  

There was no time to react.  

The creature lunged.  

Mike yelled—then *choked* as a wet, crunching sound filled the air.  

“NO—” Kayla’s scream was cut off as she scrambled in the dark.  

Darren fell, hands scrambling against the dirt. “Jess?! Kayla?!”  

A gurgled gasp—then silence.  

Something *wet* hit the ground beside him. He didn’t look. He *couldn’t.*  

The thing *moved*—fast now, with a sickening, inhuman gait.   

Darren crawled, heart hammering his ribs, desperate to get **away—**  

Then—light.  

For a split second, a blinding, white **light.**  

Not fire.  

Not natural.  

An eerie glow that bit through the trees, casting the creature’s *hideous* form in sharp relief.  

It screeched—shrill, wounded—before slipping, dissolving **into the earth.**  

Then, silence.  

The light faded as suddenly as it had arrived.  

Darren lay trembling, limbs weak, lungs heaving.  

Then—footsteps.  

Measured. Heavy.  

A figure stepped into view.  

The gas station clerk.  

He stood over Darren, his eyes dark and unreadable. “Told you,” he muttered. “She don’t like fire.”  

The Hollow pulsed around them, dark and endless.   

The forest was hungry again.  

And the Hollow always **feeds.**
